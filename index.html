    <h2>What’s the best exercise?</h2>
    <p>“What’s the best exercise for losing weight?” is a common question, according to Dr. Roman Ledger of East Bridge Hospital in San Diego. His answer? “Whatever exercise you’ll do consistently.” </p>
    <p>Running may burn more calories per minute than walking, but if you’re more likely to stay the course on a walking program, then you’ll burn more calories overall in the long run. </p>
    <p>When venturing into a new exercise program, Dr. Roman says that it’s more important to consider your own personal preferences, not the calorie listings in a diet book.</p>

    <h3>Go outside and play!</h3>
    <p>For example, if you prefer being in the great outdoors to exercising indoors, you may find that hiking becomes a constant in your life, whereas the treadmill might be tossed aside after a brief interlude.</p>
    <p>Start with your likes and dislikes, and find ways to make exercise a part of your daily life, such as walking the dog. With this approach, you’re likely to make a long commitment to an exercise program simply because it naturally enhances your life.</p>
